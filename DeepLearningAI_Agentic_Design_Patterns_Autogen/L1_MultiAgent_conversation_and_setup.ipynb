Where would you like to start?\n",

      "Absolutely, Joe! Let's start by discussing the theory behind SVMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea behind SVMs is to find the hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes. This hyperplane is the decision boundary that helps classify new data points.\n",

      "SVMs can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the choice of the kernel function. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The linear kernel is used for linearly separable data, while the polynomial and RBF kernels are used for data that is not linearly separable.\n",

      "Now, let's move on to implementing SVMs in Python. We can use popular libraries like scikit-learn to easily create and train SVM models on our data. We can also explore hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques to ensure optimal SVM performance.\n",
